Actively pulls data from Statbotics and TheBlueAlliance

v1.0.1 6/5/2025
Added main functionality of Get and Analyzing history of a team. Raw data for event data by year is not parsed at all so its all raw data from a singular event for now. Added the compare_teams function but is blank as I figure out how to best do it. There is NOW a main menu for using the tool. Maybe I'll make an interface too.


v1.0.0 6/3/2025
Match Simulator works. Public Release.
